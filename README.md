 Technology & Tools

This project harnesses the latest advances in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to deliver robust sentiment analysis.

Key Technologies:

- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):**  
  State-of-the-art transformer-based language model by Google, pre-trained on a large corpus and fine-tuned for sentiment classification tasks in this project.

- **PyTorch:**  
  Powerful, flexible deep learning framework used for building, training, and fine-tuning the BERT model.

- **HuggingFace Transformers Library:**  
  Provides pre-trained transformer models (like BERT) and tokenizers, simplifying NLP tasks and rapid prototyping.

- **Python:**  
  The programming language powering the entire pipeline, enabling integration, automation, and scripting.

**Supporting Tools & Libraries:**

- **Pandas:** Data processing, manipulation, and input/output operations for dataset handling.
- **Scikit-learn:**  
  Utilities for splitting data, calculating metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.), and supporting the ML workflow.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn:**  
  Visualization of data distributions and model results.
- **Streamlit or Flask:**  
  For deploying a simple, user-friendly web interface to interact with the sentiment analyzer.

**Project Structure Overview:**

- **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, normalization, tokenization using BERT tokenizer.
- **Modeling:** Fine-tuning and inference with BERT via PyTorch and HuggingFace.
- **Evaluation:** Performance metrics and visualizations.
- **Deployment:** Web-based interface for real-time sentiment prediction.
